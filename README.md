My App using DataScience's Frontend Code Test
==================

This is an at-home exercise that we use as part of our standard interview process for frontend and full-stack developers.

## Instructions

* Clone this repo
* Complete the exercise and submit either a zip of the solution or a link to a new repo
* You may use any resources, frameworks, libraries, etc and style the markup however you like.

## Requirements

Using the provided JSON data representing a collection of meal recipes, create a micro frontend application that meets the following criteria:

* Display a list (or table) of recipes.
* Allow filtering of recipes by a single ingredient.
* Add checkboxes to allow selection of multiple recipes.
* Show an alphabetically ordered list of distinct ingredients for the selected recipes. This should update as recipes are selected / unselected.
* Persist the selections locally and regenerate the view on page refresh.
* In a README note any required setup to be able to run the app, such as modifying hosts file, etc.

# FrontendCodeTest App Setup and Installation Instructions

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.9.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
